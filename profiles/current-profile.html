        <p><small><i>Where do you live now?</i></small><br />
          <b>Debi:</b> McFarland, WI!</p>

        <br />
        <p><small><i>What are your hobbies?</i></small><br />
          <b>Debi:</b> Reading! Also, I have a baby grand piano that I love to play because it helps me relax. And, having just moved back to WI in the last year, I've recently added boating to the list. (<i>Editor's note: I'm going to insert reading again. I'm pretty sure Debi's decision to purchase her current house was primarily driven by shelf-space availability.</i>) </p>

        <br />
        <p><small><i>What are some of the things you're most proud of from your time at Epic?</i></small><br />
          <b>Debi:</b> I loved being a TL. It was the best part of my job there. Epic hired such talented people that being a TL and helping folks realize their potential there was incredibly rewarding and for the most part, a pleasure. It's been fun to see the first team members I had go on to work for Epic abroad, succeed my tenure, and otherwise go on to great things at the company. I hope that I was a positive part of helping them build their career trajectories at Epic.</p>

        <br />
        <p><small><i>What was it that made you realize that it was time to venture beyond Epic?</i></small><br />
          <b>Debi:</b> I had a few frustrating incidents in my last year at Epic, some customer-based and some internal, and they made me feel restless. There wasn't one "straw that broke the camel's back" for me, but at the time I was 24 and didn't have any long-term commitments to the area, so it was a good time for me to venture out into the world and see what else was available. I left Epic feeling very positive about my time there, and grateful to the company for giving me such great experience and confidence; I felt, and still feel, that Epic was a critical component in my professional competence.</p>

        <br />
        <p><small><i>What have you been up to since leaving, and what are you most proud of in the time since?</i></small><br />
          <b>Debi:</b>	Immediately after leaving Epic I traveled through Southeast Asia for four months. It was a tough but amazing trip; I had to rely on myself to figure things out in very foreign cultures, and I used the time to try and develop my personal strengths and identity. Epic built my professional identity up in a concrete way, but this trip was a way for me to reorient myself to being alone with my thoughts, to having no commitments to anyone, and to recognizing my own priorities.<br /><br />

          After I got back from Asia, I moved to Chicago and worked at a company that built websites for professional services organizations. It wasn't for me, and about nine months into that I got an offer for an Epic consulting gig that was too good to turn down. I've been consulting since 2014 and haven't looked back!<br /><br />

          I'm also in the process of earning my MHA online, and will graduate in early August.</p>

        <br />
        <p><small><i>What do you wish you had known before striking out for post-Epic life?</i></small><br />
          <b>Debi:</b> I don't regret leaving, but I wish I had enjoyed myself there more. I think I was too young to understand how businesses really work and how universal some of the frustrations are; I took myself too seriously and felt personally affronted by the inefficiency of bureaucracy (laughable in retrospect!). I would have been happier if I had divorced myself from the idea that I was entitled to work at a perfectly optimized and streamlined company. That company does not exist.</p>

        <br />
        <p><small><i>What's next for you?</i></small><br />
          <b>Debi:</b> Consulting is a great fit for me, and I'm hoping to stick with it as long as I can. I love the freedom to choose my contracts and travel to different parts of the country; I enjoy the variety of problems I'm brought in to solve; I enjoy the finality of being able to walk away from customers and projects and really be "done" with something. I didn't intend to go into consulting when I left Epic, but I'm lucky I was afforded the opportunity and glad that I made the jump. I'm hoping that with my MHA I can transition into more strategic consulting and away from strictly Epic work.<br /><br />

          Past that, I'm just constantly refining my Excel workbook that calculates the age at which I can retire, and trying to contribute more to my index funds. I'd love to keep working hard now and retire at 50.... But we'll see what the Excel document says.</p>

        <br />
      </div><!--/column-->

      <p><b>Reader, virtuoso, Excel savant, and probably one of the funniest people you'd ever meet... Keep plugging away at the MHA, Debi! Good luck, and let us know when you decide to open-source the retirement calculator project :)</b></p>
