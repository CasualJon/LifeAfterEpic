				<h1>You're going to do great things!</h1>
        <p>Before you start that journey, below are things to consider as you make your plan.</p>
      </br>
        <div class="text-left">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Health insurance</b></br>
            Your health insurance remains active for the calendar month of your departure.</br>
            If possible, consider an end date earlier in the month and get those doctor/dental</br>
            appointments on the books. If you do not have another option for health insurance</br>
            (spouse/partner, another job),
            you are able to use <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/cobra-continuation-health-coverage-compliance">COBRA</a>
            to extend your existing coverage.</li>
            </br>

            <li><b>401(k)</b></br>
            You can leave your 401(k) with Fidelity if you like what you have setup.</br>
            To roll your 401(k) over into an IRA, you'll need an open Individual Retirement Account.</br>
            You'll call Fidelity, they will ask for the institution holding your IRA, then mail YOU</br>
            a check for your balance (EOD of the day you call) to liquidate the account.</br>
            You will then need to send the check to your IRA institution.</br>
            <a href="https://www.moneyunder30.com/rollover-your-401k">Read about your options.</a></li>
            </br>

            <li><b>Stock Appreciation Rights</b></br>
            If you have SARs, you will need to request payout.</br>
            Depending on the amount, you may need to make a early tax payment to the IRS.</br>
            <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes">
            There are additional conditions, but if you expect to owe at least $1,000 in</br>
            federal tax for the year (after subtracting withholdings and credits), the IRS may</br>
            require a quarterly estimated tax payment.</a> If unsure, consult a professional.</li>
            </br>

            <li><b>Eureka</b></br>
            You'll need access to Eureka (UtiliPro) after your departure for things like W2s, past</br>
            pay stubs, contact details for benefits, etc. Update your Eureka password before your</br>
            departure (to reset the change required/lockout counter), and save the link on your home</br>
            computer so you'll remember it.</li>
            </br>

            <li><b>NVTs</b></br>
            Not everyone intends head toward consulting in their post-Epic career. Even if you</br>
            don't, make the time to update your certifications. It won't hurt to have a fallback,</br>
            and you are unable to do update any certifications during the non-compete period.</li>
            </br>

            <li><b>Clean your PC/laptop</b></br>
            Much of your life probably lives on your work machine.  PDFs from a mortgage,</br>
            account informaiton (websites/rewards programs), music, resum√©s, pictures, those</br>
            rough drafts of your wedding vows... You need not worry about inappropriate use</br>
            (CaTS is solid), but you will want or need these things for yourself.</li>
            </br>

            <li><b>Update account contact info</b></br>
            You may have many accounts where your listed contact information includes your Epic</br>
            email address, phone number, or address. Upadte these with your personal contact</br>
            details before your departure. Resetting passwords or making changes later difficult.</li>
            </br>

            <li><b>TLG data</b></br>
            All that time you logged in DeLorean/TimeTurner/Text. Some professional credentials</br>
            and certifications (or even future employers) will want details about the number of</br>
            hours spent on certain types of tasks or domains.</li>
            </br>

            <li><b>Recognize that not everyone will know how to respond</b></br>
            Some won't understand, some will be jealous, some will think of how it affects them.</br>
            That's not for you to worry over, you don't need the approval of others.</br>
            Some will be sad to see you go. Some will be excited for you.</br>
            Thank these people for the time you were able to share together.</br>
            Most will ask you what you're going to do next, but that doesn't mean you need to know;</br>
            your don't have to let a career define you.</li>
            </br>

            <li><b>Don't be a jerk</b></br>
            Pull your weight until the exit interview.</li>
