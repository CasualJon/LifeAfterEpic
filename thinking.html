				<h2>You're going to do great things!</h2>
        <p>Before you start that journey, below are items to consider as you make your plan.</p>
      <br />
        <div class="text-left">
          <ul>
            <li><b>Have an open dialogue with your TL</b><br />
            Something has you thinking about setting off on your own. If that something is a need
            that's absent, then try a frank conversation with your team lead.
            <i>The chances of getting what you want increase dramatically if you actually ask.</i><br />
            I've seen people ready to leave express their concerns and get what was necessary to make them happy.
            Of course, things might not change, but at least you will never need to ponder "what if?"</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Health insurance</b><br />
            Your health insurance remains active for the calendar month of your departure.<br />
            If possible, consider an end date earlier in the month and get those doctor/dental
            appointments on the books. If you do not have another option for health insurance
            (spouse/partner, another job), you can use
            <a href="https://www.dol.gov/agencies/ebsa/about-ebsa/our-activities/resource-center/faqs/cobra-continuation-health-coverage-compliance" target="_blank">COBRA</a>
            to extend your existing coverage.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>401(k)</b><br />
            <a href="https://www.moneyunder30.com/rollover-your-401k" target="_blank">Read about your options.</a><br />
            You can leave your 401(k) with Fidelity if you like what you have set up.<br />
            To roll your 401(k) into an IRA, you'll need an open Individual Retirement Account.<br />
            Fidelity will ask for the institution holding your IRA, then mail YOU a check
            for your balance (EOD of the day you call) to liquidate the account. You will then
            need to send that check to your IRA institution.<br />
            Rolling your Epic 401(k) into that of another employer is also an option.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Stock: Appreciation Rights</b><br />
            If you have vested SARs, you will need to request payout.<br />
            Check current rules, but you may have up to 90 days post-departure to request
            payout. This might be useful if you're waiting for the new share price in Feb/March.<br />
            Depending on the amount, you may need to make a early tax payment to the IRS.<br />
            <a href="https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes" target="_blank">
            There are additional conditions, but if you expect to owe at least $1,000 in
            federal tax for the year (after subtracting withholdings and credits), the IRS may
            require a quarterly estimated tax payment.</a> If unsure, consult a professional.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Stock: Class B (Options)</b><br />
            If you exercised Class B Stock Options, which replaced SARs as merit awards in 2017,
            then these are not yet vested (I believe the first round of vesting is June 2019).<br />
            Firstly, recall that your non-compete was extended to 2 years when signing the paperwork.
            Secondly, the vesting schedule for your tenured shares will also determine what percentage
            of your purchased shares will be bought back by Epic at the current stock price (and what
            percentage will be bought back at the purchase price <eyeroll>). You should work with a tax
            professional to make certain, but bear in mind that tax implications will include the the
            potential need of an early estimated tax payment (consideration listed above with SARs),
            and will be affected by whether you opted for 83b status of any tenured shares (selling
            shares back is taxed as long-term capital gains vs. regular income).</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Stock: Class A</b><br />
            I cannot help you, but I hope that you enjoy retirement!</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Vacation days & Sick days</b><br />
            Hopefully you already know that once you give notice, you do not get to take vacation time.
            There could be some extraordinary situation, but expect that you will be unable to use these days.
            Epic will pay you for acrued, unused vacation days held at the time of your departure. However,
            unless you have greater than 65 acrued sick days, that time is gone and will not be reimbursed. Should
            you have spent the 11 years it takes to accumulate 65 sick days (at a minimum, assuming you used none),
            check the Redbook on how to request payout... you may need to do this before you give notice.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Eureka</b><br />
            You'll need access to <a href="https://n22.ultipro.com/default.aspx" target="_blank">Eureka (UltiPro)</a>
            after your departure for things like W2s, past<br />
            pay stubs, contact details for benefits, etc. Update your Eureka password before your
            departure (to reset the counter for their outlandish password change timing requirements),
            and save the link on your home computer so you'll have easy access to it.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>NVTs/CEEs</b><br />
            Not everyone intends head toward consulting in their post-Epic career. Even if you
            don't, make time to update your certifications. It won't hurt to have a fallback, and
            you are unable to update those certifications during the non-compete period.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Clean your PC/laptop</b><br />
            Much of your life probably lives on your work machine.  PDFs from mortgage documents,
            website/reward program account information, music, résumés, pictures, those first
            rough drafts of your wedding vows... You need not worry about inappropriate use of
            these (CaTS is solid), but you will want these things for yourself.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Update account contact info</b><br />
            You probably have accounts where your listed contact information is your Epic
            email address or phone number (Delta, Marriott, National, etc.). Update these with your personal
            contact details before your departure. Resetting passwords or making changes later can be difficult.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>TLG data</b><br />
            All that time you logged in DeLorean/TimeTurner/TLG? Some professional credentials
            and certifications (or even future employers) can want details about the number of
            hours spent on certain types of tasks or domains.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Recognize that not everyone will know how to respond</b><br />
            Some won't understand, some will be jealous, some will think of how it affects them.<br />
            That's not for you to worry over, you don't need the approval of others.<br />
            Some will be sad to see you go. Some will be excited for you.<br />
            Thank these people for the time you were able to share together.<br />
            Most will ask you what you're going to do next, but that doesn't mean you need to know;
            you don't have to let a career define you.</li>
            <br />

            <li><b>Don't be a jerk</b><br />
            Pull your weight until the exit interview.</li>
