        <p><big><i>Pro Tip:</i> Everyone suffers from Imposter Syndrome. If you embark on a new
                career, you will feel stress. You will not immediately understand what is
                going on as you get up-to-speed. This does not mean you are inadequate, it
                just means that you are learning.</big></p>

				<h4>Job Searching</h4>
        <div class="text-left">
        <p>It's been a while since you've searched for a job, and rejection can be painful (it sucks).
           Listen, Epic's HR practices are well known and highly respected by companies across many industries,
           but that doesn't mean that this will be - or should be - a cake walk. If you believe so, then
           understand that it's exactly this thinking that will make landing something you love burdensome.</p>
           <p>Having come from a company widely known for only hiring the best and brightest low-single-digit
           percentage of applicants is a mark in your favor, not a golden key. If you desire something that makes
           you want to get out of bed in the morning, then know that finding that perfect job will be a job...
           you'll need to put work into it. </p>
        <br />

          <ul>
            <li>Create a job search/professional-looking email address</li>
            <ul><small>
              <li>This goes on your resume, online applications, LinkedIn, etc. and will be how people know you before meeting you</li>
              <li>FirstName.Initial.LastName@email.com is simple and respectable</li>
              <li>A personal domain is costlier, but an option if all the good gmail addresses are gone</li>
              <li>No one wants to see (or hire) the address you created referencing that song you love</li>
              <li>No one wants to see (or hire) that @university.edu address you might still use, it will look like you haven't moved on from college</li>
            </ul></small>
            <li>Most worthwhile job search sites offer advanced options to refine or target your job search</li>
              <ul><small>
                <li>City, State, ZIP, and Radius (within x miles of...)</li>

              <li>There are many job search sites, so don't limit yourself</li>
              <li>Employers might use services to robo-post one position to many listings, but don't assume it</li>
              <li>Many job search sites exist to focus on niche areas (e.g. Dice below focuses on Tech sector jobs, Idealist focuses on social impact)</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Employers might limit open positions to sites specializing in a target audience</li>
                  <li>With so many out there, run a quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&q=niche+job+search+sites" target="_blank">
                    Google search</a> to is if a niche board piques your interest</li>

                <li>Investigate the company and the role as you apply, and recognize that you might
                   need to customize your resume and cover letter to match the position</li>
                <li>Rejection can be hard, but you cannot take it personally... sometimes they already
                    knew who they were going to hire, but had to go through the process of posting the job</li>
                <li>You won't even hear back on some applications (like when I applied to be Global Product Lead
                    for the Halo franchise, or my friend applied to be UW-Madison Football's Head Coach)</li>
                <li>Don't stop applying to jobs even if you've found your dream</li>

                    <li>It is likely also someone else's dream</li>

              <p>Finally, please bear this in mind: one of the most common regrets I hear from people once
                 they've moved on to a new job is wishing they had taken better advantage of that time between jobs.</p>
              <p>Yes, not making money as bills still arrive is stressful, and though hunting for something that excites
                 you is exciting itself, remember to (at least try to) enjoy any free time you have. Do the things you that
                 you cannot when you work full-time. So, if your situation allows, try not to miss the opportunities
                 that having a little free time carries, or you might wind up regretting it.</p>
