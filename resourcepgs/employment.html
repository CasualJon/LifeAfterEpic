        <h4>Job Searching</h4>
        <div class="text-left">
          <p>It&#39;s been a while since you&#39;ve searched for a job, and rejection can be painful (it sucks).
             Listen, Epic&#39;s HR practices are well known and highly respected by companies across many industries,
             but that doesn&#39;t mean that this will be - or should be - a cake walk. If you believe so, then
             understand that it&#39;s exactly this thinking that will make landing something you love burdensome.</p>
             <p>Having come from a company widely known for only hiring the best and brightest low-single-digit
             percentage of applicants is a mark in your favor, not a golden key. If you desire something that makes
             you want to get out of bed in the morning, then know that finding that perfect job will be a job...
             you&#39;ll need to put work into it. </p>
          <br />

          <ul>
            <li>Create a job search/professional-looking email address</li>
            <ul><small>
              <li>This goes on your resume, online applications, LinkedIn, etc. and will be how people know you before meeting you</li>
              <li>FirstName.Initial.LastName@email.com is simple and respectable</li>
              <li>A personal domain is costlier, but an option if all the good gmail addresses are gone</li>
              <li>No one wants to see (or hire) the address you created referencing that song you love</li>
              <li>No one wants to see (or hire) that @university.edu address you might still use: it will look like you haven&#39;t moved on from college</li>
            </ul></small>
            <li>Most worthwhile job search sites offer advanced options to refine or target your job search</li>
              <ul><small>
                <li>City, State, ZIP, and Radius (within x miles of...)</li>
                <li>Keywords (both inclusive and exclusive)</li>
                <li>Job Function and Type of Job (full time, internship, etc.)</li>
                <li>Education and Experience</li>
                <li>Industry</li>
                <li>Salary</li>
              </ul></small>
            <li>Search all the things!</li>
            <ul><small>
              <li>There are many job search sites, so don&#39;t limit yourself</li>
              <li>Employers might use services to robo-post one position to many listings, but don&#39;t assume it</li>
              <li>Many job search sites exist to focus on niche areas (e.g. Dice below focuses on Tech sector jobs, Idealist focuses on jobs with a social impact)</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Employers might limit open positions to sites specializing in a target audience</li>
                  <li>With so many out there, run a quick <a href="https://www.google.com/search?source=hp&q=niche+job+search+sites" target="_blank">
                    Google search</a> to is if a niche board piques your interest</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Go directly to the source</li>
              <ul>
                <li>Want to work for Apple, Google, UW-Madison, the US Forest Service, etc.&#63;</li>
                <li>Most organizations post available jobs on their website, so if there&#39;s somewhere you want to be, you know where to go</li>
              </ul>

        <p>Your parents or an old coach would tell you that practice makes perfect... Well, they were right, but

              <li>Why was there a gap in your employment&#63;</li>
            </ul></small>
          <li>Off the wall (and sometimes absurd) questions are intended to expose sub-surface elements about
              you such as stress responses, problem solving skills, and personality traits</q>
            <ul><small>
              <li>How many square yards of Astro Turf are there in the U.S.&#63;</li>
              <li>How many tennis balls can you fit into a limousine&#63;</li>
              <i>These types of questions are designed to test whether you can understand what is asked of you,
                  whether you can construct and set in motion a systematic and logical way of responding, as
                  well as how you might deal with the unexpected</i>

              <li>If you could have lunch with one person, dead or alive, who would it be&#63;</li>
              <i>These types of questions don&#39;t really have a wrong answer, but are designed to test how you
                  think on your feet, how you might relate your own strengths or weaknesses, how you might
                  see yourself, and the like</i>
            </ul></small>
          <li>Know that the question, "what is your biggest weakness," can distinguish you</li>
            <ul><small>
              <li>DO NOT give some bullshit answer like being a perfectionist, a workaholic, caring too much, being too
                  passionate about the work you do, or something similarly fake. Especially avoid joking about your
                  greatest weakness being that you have no weaknesses or disguising a strength as a weakness</li>
              <li><u>Everyone</u> is human with faults and failings. This question is designed to put you on the
                  spot to make sure you understand yours</li>
              <li>First: Self-awareness -- Interviewers want to know whether you are and have been introspective about
                  your flaws, shortcomings, and limitations</li>
              <li>Second: Honesty -- Interviewers what to know that prospective employees will be honest with them, as
                  well as with themselves and respond to the question in an open way</li>
              <li>Third: Self-improvement -- If you are self-aware and honest with yourself to the point of knowing there
                  is a problem, what are you doing/have you done to improve&#63;</li>
              <li>Fourth: Professional -- Interviewers don&#39;t want to know about your fear of horses or of dying alone.
                  Don&#39;t talk about details of your personal life impacting your job performance as a weakness. Don&#39;t
                  make it weird, don&#39;t give away the store, just focus on one weakness relevant to your work life</li>
              <li>Lastly, be prepared to talk about more than one weakness. Sometimes interviewers will try to throw
                  you off with a follow-up question of "What are some other weaknesses&#63;"</li>
            </ul></small>
          <li>Learn how to listen</li>
            <ul><small>
              <li>Interviews are an opportunity to sell yourself, but do you generally like people who only talk?</li>
              <li>Don&#39;t get so caught up in trying to push a message and image to a prospective employer that you fail
                  to listen... what use do they have for an employee that doesn&#39;t listen&#63;</li>
              <li>Make sure that you practice listening carefully without interrupting as others speak</li>
              <li>Be prepared to ask questions, listen to the responses, and ask follow-up questions based on the responses</li>
            </ul></small>
          <li>Look the part</li>
            <ul><small>
              <li>Dress up a level to the position for which you&#39;re interviewing</li>
              <li>Not every company has a loose dress code</li>
              <li>If your shoes are leather, polish them: it&#39;s one of the first things people will notice</li>
            </ul></small>
          <li>Follow-up on the interview, and send a thank you note (hand written if you can) - - it matters</li>

           but that doesn't mean that this will be - or should be - a cake walk. If you believe so, then
           understand that it's exactly this thinking that will make landing something you love burdensome.</p>
           <p>Having come from a company widely known for only hiring the best and brightest low-single-digit
           percentage of applicants is a mark in your favor, not a golden key. If you desire something that makes
           you want to get out of bed in the morning, then know that finding that perfect job will be a job...
           you'll need to put work into it. </p>

                 need to customize your resume and cover letter to match the position</li>

            <p>Yes, not making money as bills still arrive is stressful, and while hunting for something that excites
               you is exciting itself, remember to (at least try to) enjoy any free time you have. Do the things you that
               you cannot when you work full-time. So, if your situation allows, take advantage of the opportunities
               that having free time offers, or you might wind up regretting it.</p>

                <i>These types of questions are designed to test whether you can understand what is asked of you,
                    whether you can construct and set in motion a systematic and logical way of responding, as

                    think on your feet, how you might relate your own strengths or weaknesses, how you might
                    see yourself, and the like</i>

                    passionate about the work you do, or something similarly fake. Especially avoid joking about your
                    greatest weakness being that you have no weaknesses or disguising a strength as a weakness</li>
                <li><u>Everyone</u> is human with faults and failings. This question is designed to put you on the
                    spot to make sure you understand yours</li>
                <li>First: Self-awareness -- Interviewers want to know whether you are and have been introspective about

                    Don't talk about details of your personal life impacting your job performance as a weakness. Don't
                    make it weird, don't give away the store, just focus on one weakness relevant to your work life</li>
                <li>Lastly, be prepared to talk about more than one weakness. Sometimes interviewers will try to throw
                    you off with a follow-up question of "What are some other weaknesses?"</li>

                    to listen... what use do they have for an employee that doesn't listen?</li>
                <li>Make sure that you practice listening carefully without interrupting as others speak</li>
